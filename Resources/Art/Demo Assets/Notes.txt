Hi Bike,

I'm just leaving you this memo before I sign off for the night. This is probably a good habit to get into.

LOVE_attack was just a last-minute thought. Maybe it could be a projectile firing animation?
LOVE_jump is the initial animation for starting a jump in game. You should probably just omit this in favor of using just LOVE_fall for jumping.
LOVE_fall is how the character appears while falling.

It's probably a good idea to just continue this thread in the same .txt. Other discussions can have their own threads. 
Separate posts in here with 10 ='s.
That seems like it could work. If you've got other ideas for logging our progress this way, lemme know son.
Sound good?
